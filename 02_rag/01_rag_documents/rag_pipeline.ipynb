      "\n",
      "ANSWER:\n",
      " UBS indicates that in 2025, various jurisdictions, including the EU, UK, and US, are shifting their regulatory approaches towards promoting a growth- and competitiveness-focused agenda, while Switzerland remains focused on strengthening its regulatory environment (page 46). This situation contributes to ongoing regulatory fragmentation (page 46). UBS believes that its proactive management of regulatory change positions it well to handle upcoming challenges in the regulatory environment (page 46). However, it also notes that Switzerland is expected to introduce proposals for regulatory changes in 2025, particularly in response to the failure of Credit Suisse, which may include adjustments to capital and liquidity requirements (page 51). These changes could place UBS at a competitive disadvantage compared to institutions subject to less stringent regulations (page 51). Additionally, UBS has moved significant operations into subsidiaries to improve resolvability and meet regulatory requirements, which has resulted in increased costs and reduced operational flexibility (page 51).\n",

      "ANSWER:\n",
      " UBS's acquisition of Credit Suisse Group AG exposes the company to heightened litigation risk and regulatory scrutiny (page 50). This acquisition entails significant additional costs, liabilities, and business integration risks (page 50). UBS inherited claims against Credit Suisse entities as part of the acquisition, which may be material to the operating results of the combined group (page 58). The extent of UBS's financial exposure to these inherited matters is material and could substantially exceed the established provisions (page 58). Additionally, UBS's exposure to ongoing and future litigation and regulatory matters has materially increased due to the merger (page 50). The risks associated with these legal matters could negatively affect public perception and the company's reputation (page 58).\n",

      "\n",
      "ANSWER:\n",
      " UBS acknowledges that risks may only become apparent with hindsight, particularly in the context of risk management failures and extreme market events (page 54). The firm emphasizes the importance of diligently identifying, assessing, managing, and controlling risks, not only under normal market conditions but also during more extreme, stressed conditions (page 54). UBS has experienced significant losses in the past due to such failures, including substantial losses during the 2008 financial crisis and other incidents (page 54). Additionally, the firm faces operational risks that could lead to material losses if internal controls fail or prove ineffective (page 53). The integration of the Credit Suisse Group may further elevate these operational risks, as the two firms have historically operated under different procedures and systems (page 53). Therefore, UBS recognizes that the consequences of certain risks may not be fully understood until after they have materialized (page 54).\n",

      "ANSWER:\n",
      " 'Critical accounting estimates and judgments' refer to the application of judgment and the making of estimates and assumptions in preparing financial statements in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards (page 64). These estimates may involve significant uncertainty at the time they are made and are regularly reassessed to ensure their relevance based on current conditions (page 64). Key areas that require a high degree of judgment include the measurement of fair value, expected credit losses, and provisions for litigation (page 61). Changes in these estimates and assumptions can significantly affect the financial statements, potentially leading to substantial losses if actual results differ from the estimates (page 64). Therefore, the accuracy of these estimates is crucial for presenting a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group (page 61).\n",

      " UBS mentions heightened litigation risk and regulatory scrutiny related to the Credit Suisse integration in their Annual Report 2024. The acquisition of Credit Suisse Group AG exposes UBS to significant additional costs, liabilities, and business integration risks (page 50). As a result of the merger, UBS has inherited all ongoing and future litigation and regulatory matters from Credit Suisse, materially increasing its exposure to these risks (page 50). Since the acquisition, UBS has faced various litigation claims under Swiss merger law, alleging that Credit Suisse shareholders received disadvantaged treatment (page 58). Additionally, there are numerous cases against the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) regarding the write-down of Credit Suisse's additional tier 1 bonds, in which UBS is participating as an aggrieved party (page 58). UBS acknowledges that the cumulative effects of these litigations may have material adverse consequences for the combined Group (page 58). Furthermore, UBS is in active dialogue with regulators to improve its operational risk management and other frameworks, but there is no assurance that these efforts will yield the desired outcomes (page 58).\n",
